# MobMon - The Mobile Monitor App

Welcome to MobMon, a mobile dock application that lets you monitor your hardware statistics in an application instead of taking up precious monitor real-estate.

The application were planned briefly before implementation started, and were then developed in a continuous sprint of three weeks.

### Dependencies
The MobMon application is dependent on being provided data from an external source to be able to display any statistics. These dependencies are:

* MSI Afterburner
* MSI Afterburner Remote Server
* (Optional) Rivatuner Statistics Server

Finding out where to find these applications and things to consider when you have installed them can be found on the [Wiki of this repository](https://github.com/nizos/MobMon/wiki/Connection-Components-Installation-Guide)
